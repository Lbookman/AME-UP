	Transmission lines with a voltage of 115kV or greater must obtain a Certificate of
	Environmental Compatibility (CEC) from the Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC). A CEC
	evidences the approval by the state of the sites for a plant or transmission line, or both. The
	requirements for routing and permitting electric transmission lines are found under the title
	‘Public Utilities and Carriers’ in the Arizona Revised Statute Title 40, Chapter 2, Article 6.2. The
	application for a CEC must include a description of the proposed facility and any environmental
	studies the applicant has or intends to perform in connection with the proposed facility.><br/><br/>

	The CEC granted by the Transmission Line Siting Committee must follow all applicable
	ordinances, master plans and regulations of the state, a county or an incorporated city or town in
	which a facility will be located. Construction of a transmission line and associated facilities (such
	as substations) may be subject to lands use permitting requirements. Commonly required local
	permits include (but are not limited to) Conditional Use Permits, Special Use Permits, Zoning
	Use Permits, and Right-of- Way (ROW) Permits.
