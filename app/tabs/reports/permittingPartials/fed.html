	and therefore subject to the following: Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act; National
	Environmental Policy Act; National Historic Preservation Act, and other regulations. As such, the
	following permits, approvals, or processes are likely to be required:

	<ul>
		<li id="fed-cwa" ><b>Clean Water Act (CWA):</b> A 404 Permit from the United States Army Corps of Engineers
		(USACE) is required before dredged or fill material may be discharged into waters of the
		United States, including wetlands. The application process begins when the developer and
		USACE conduct a pre-application consultation, to see if the proposed activity qualifies for a
		general permit, which authorize common activities that are minimally impacting both
		individually and cumulatively, and that meet the terms and conditions of the general permit.
		If there are no applicable general permits to fit the activity, the developer should contact the
		USACE district to determine whether an individual permit is necessary, or whether they
		should pursue a Letter of Permission or a Standard Individual Permit.<br/>

		<li id="fed-esa" ><b>Endangered Species Act (ESA):</b> All Federal agencies are mandated to protect and preserve
		species and their habitat. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and the National
		Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) oversee the ESA to ensure that other agencies plan or
		modify projects so that they will have minimal impact on listed species and their habitats.
		Section 7 consultation (formal or informal), Biological Evaluation, Biological Opinion,
		Incidental Take Permit, Section 10 permit (for projects with no Federal funding, permits, or
		activity), Habitat Conservation Plan, and other documents, permits, or approvals may be
		required and will be determined by the USFWS (The Shipley Group, Overview of the
		Endangered Species Act).<br/>

		<li id="fed-nepa" ><b>National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA):</b> All Federal agencies are required to
		implement the procedural provisions of NEPA except where compliance would be
		inconsistent with other statutory requirements (40 CFR §1500.3 Mandate). NEPA procedures
		must ensure that environmental information is available to public officials and citizens before
		decisions are made and before actions are taken (40 CFR §1500.1b Purpose). Environmental
		analysis of a proposed project is contained in either an Environmental Assessment (EA),
		Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), or Categorical Exclusion. The content of the
		environmental analysis must provide the decision maker (typically a Federal agency) with the
		information needed to make an informed, reasoned decision that will stand in a court of law
		(How to Manage the NEPA Process – The Shipley Group).<br/>

		<li id="fed-nhpa" ><b>National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA):</b> The responsible Federal agency will
		determine if an activity could affect historic properties, and if so, it must identify the
		appropriate State Historic Preservation Officer/Tribal Historic Preservation Officer
		(SHPO/THPO) to consult during the process along with the public and/or other potential
		consulting parties.<br/><br/>

		The agency proceeds to identify historic properties in the area of potential effects of a given
		activity, with the review of background information, consulting with the SHPO and the
		necessary studies. If questions arise about the eligibility of a given property, the agency may
		seek a formal determination of eligibility from the National Park Service. If the agency finds
		that no historic properties are present or affected, it provides documentation to the
		SHPO/THPO and proceeds with its undertaking. If it finds that historic properties are present,
		it proceeds to assess possible adverse effects based on criteria found in ACHP’s regulations.<br/><br/>

		In the case of finding possible adverse effects, the agency begins consultation with the SHPO
		and others to seek ways to avoid, minimize, or mitigate the adverse effects. Consultation
		usually results in a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), which outlines agreed-upon
		measures to tackle such adverse effects, but if such consultation proves unproductive, the
		SHPO, or ACHP itself, may terminate consultation and proceed to get ACHP’s decision.<br/><br/>

		The Arizona State Historic Preservation Act (SHPA) developed by the SHPO, agency
		officials, tribal representatives, and preservation consultants, states the criteria of eligibility
		for the Arizona Register of Historic Places, which is a list of Arizona’s historic properties
		worthy of preservation, and a planning tool for use by federal, state and local governments,
		private groups and citizens. More information and guidelines are found in <a href="https://azstateparks.com/national-register-of-historic-places">AZ State Parks:
		National Register of Historic Places</a>.
