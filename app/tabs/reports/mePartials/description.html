Some or all of this land sits below <b>{{feature['Restriction Type']}}</b> with a <b>{{feature['Minimum Altitude']}}-foot floor</b>, meaning that the military has historically engaged in airborne activities as low as <b>{{feature['Minimum Altitude']}}</b> feet above the landâ€™s surface. Based on this history of use, there would be a <b>{{feature['likelihood']}} likelihood of conflict</b> between existing military activities and the proposed project.

The United States Department of Defense and/or its governmental affiliates hold legal title to some or all of this land and use it for military purposes.  Because of this ownership and use, this land is <b>probably not available for private renewable energy development</b>.  A developer would need to secure a right-of-way or other sufficient property interest from the Department of Defense to develop a project on the land, and grants of such property interests are rare.  For inquiries regarding how military uses of this land might impact renewable energy development in surrounding areas, please contact the military liaison listed below.
